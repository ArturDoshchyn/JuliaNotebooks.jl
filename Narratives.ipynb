With information frictions, it is people who pay attention to inflation and tend to overreact to it that get info first, and then spread their narrative. "

It can be shown that households pick to update their info with intervals $d$ rather than every period. $d$ becomes shorter when $\\kappa$ falls, or when inflation persistence $\\rho$ or variance $\\sigma^2$ raise. Moreover, when $\\kappa$ is sufficiently large and $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are sufficiently low, agents can **switch off their updating altogether**"
